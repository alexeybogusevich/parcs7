# PARCS-NET-K8

## Overview
PARCS-NET-K8 is a solution for deploying and managing algorithmic modules that solve recursive parallel computation problems. This repository contains the necessary files and configurations to deploy the solution onto Azure as an AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) service. It also provides a local development environment using Docker Compose.

## Deployment
To deploy the solution onto Azure as an AKS service, follow these steps:

1. Create a custom deployment from the ARM (Azure Resource Manager) template located at `infra/azuredeploy.json`. This template will provision the necessary Azure resources for the AKS cluster.

2. Configure the AKS cluster by applying the YAML file located at `kube/deployment.azure.yaml`. This file specifies the desired state of the AKS cluster and sets up the necessary configurations for the algorithmic modules.

## Local Development
For local development and debugging, you can use Docker Compose. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Docker Compose installed on your local machine.

2. Use the `src/docker-compose.yml` file to set up the local development environment. This file defines the necessary services and their configurations.

3. Build and run the Docker Compose setup using the following command:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This will create the required containers and start the local development environment.

## NuGet Package
The solution depends on a NuGet package named "Parcs.Net" (version 4.0.0). You can find the package on NuGet.org at the following URL: [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Parcs.Net/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Parcs.Net/)

Make sure to include this package in your project to utilize the algorithmic modules provided by the solution.
